## Wallets 

### Deterministic Wallet Formats

#### Type 1: Single Chain Wallets

{% autocrossref %}

Type 1 deterministic wallets are the simpler of the two, which can
create a single series of keys from a single seed. A primary weakness is
that if the seed is leaked, all funds are compromised, and wallet
sharing is extremely limited.
