The Developer Reference aims to provide specifications and APIs information
to help you start building Bitcoin-based applications. To make the best use of
this documentation, you may want to install the current version of Bitcoin
Core, either from [source][core git] or from a [pre-compiled executable][core executable].

Questions about Bitcoin development are best sent to the Bitcoin [Forum][forum
tech support] and [IRC channels][]. Errors or suggestions related to
documentation on Bitcoin.org can be [submitted as an issue][docs issue]
or posted to the [bitcoin-documentation mailing list][].

In the following documentation, some strings have been shortened or wrapped: "[...]"
indicates extra data was removed, and lines ending in a single backslash "\\"
are continued below. If you hover your mouse over a paragraph, cross-reference
links will be shown in blue.  If you hover over a cross-reference link, a brief
definition of the term will be displayed in a tooltip.
