<p>We recently learned that a component of Android responsible for generating secure random numbers contains critical weaknesses, that render all Android wallets generated to date vulnerable to theft. Because the problem lies with Android itself, this problem will affect you if you have a wallet generated by any Android app. An incomplete list would be <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet&hl=en">Bitcoin Wallet</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=piuk.blockchain.android&hl=en">blockchain.info</a> wallet, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miracleas.bitcoin_spinner&hl=en">BitcoinSpinner</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet&hl=en">Mycelium Wallet</a>.</p>

<p>In order to re-secure existing wallets, key rotation is necessary. This involves generating a new address with a repaired random number generator and then sending all the money in your wallet back to yourself. If you use an Android wallet then we strongly recommended you upgrade to the latest version available in the Play Store as soon as one becomes available. Once your wallet is rotated, you will need to contact anyone who has stored addresses generated by your phone and give them a new one. </p>

<p>If you use Bitcoin Wallet by Andreas Schildbach, key rotation will occur automatically soon after you upgrade. The old addresses will be marked as insecure in your address book. You will need to make a fresh backup.</p>

<p>Updates for other wallet apps should be released shortly.</p>
