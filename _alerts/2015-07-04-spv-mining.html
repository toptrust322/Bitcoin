<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Your bitcoins are safe if you received them in transactions confirmed before 2015-07-04 07:00 UTC.</p>

<p>After that time, confirmation scores are not as reliable as they
usually are for users of certain software:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Lightweight (SPV) wallet users</b> should wait an additional {{confs}}
  confirmations more than you would normally wait.</li>

  <li><b>Bitcoin Core 0.9.4 or earlier users</b> should wait an
  additional {{confs}} confirmations more than you would normally
  wait or upgrade to <a href="/en/download">Bitcoin Core 0.10.2</a>.</b></li>

  <li><b>Web wallet users</b> should wait an additional {{confs}} confirmations
  more than you would normally wait, unless you know for sure that your
  wallet is secured by Bitcoin Core 0.9.5 or later.</li>

  <li><b>Bitcoin Core 0.9.5 or later users are unaffected.</b></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="miners">Miners</h2>

If you pool mine, please switch to a pool that properly validates
blocks.  (If you solo mine, please switch to Bitcoin Core 0.10.2.)

<p><b>Bad pools:</b> these pools are not correctly validating, and are
losing money.</p>

<ul>
 <li>BTC Nuggets</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Good pools:</b> these pools properly validate blocks.  Please
switch to them, at least until the bad pools have fixed their
systems.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="cause">What's Happening</h2>

<p>Some miners are currently generating invalid blocks.   Almost all
software besides Bitcoin Core 0.9.5 and later will accept these invalid
blocks under certain conditions.</p>
