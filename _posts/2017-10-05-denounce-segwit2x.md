title: "Bitcoin.org to denounce Segwit2x"

On 2017-10-11 at noon (UTC), Bitcoin.org is planning to publish a banner on every page of the site warning users about the risks of using services that will default to the so-called Segwit2x (S2X) contentious hard fork. S2X companies will be called out by name. To ensure that we only warn users against companies that will actually put user deposits at risk, we urge all companies to publicly clarify their stance before the above date, either by a highly-visible public statement or by commenting on Bitcoin.org issue #[1835](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1835) (or by doing both).

If there are mitigating factors, such as your company planning to continue supporting Bitcoin by default and only supporting S2X insofar as required to allow users to sell or withdraw their S2X coins, please inform us of these details on the above issue so we can remove your entry if appropriate.

By default, we will be using the following list of companies known to support S2X in our warning:
