[Berlin Bitcoin Hackathon](http://bitcoin-hackathon.com/), 13-15 July: hackers will gather in Berlin geekdom for a weekend of intense coding an collaboration. Sunday we party at [room77](http://www.qype.co.uk/place/21545-Room-77-Berlin): the restaurant at the end of capitalism. Participants are coming in from Switzerland, Austria and Finland. The event is free.

Important: this event is for the general public, and not only programmers. We actively welcome people with diverse skills like media or activism. There are many [interesting non-programmer](http://bitcoin-hackathon.com/index.php/Main_Page#Ideas) projects like a street marketing campaign, or graffiti designs for the guerilla artist.

Refreshments and food are sponsored. Best three teams win prizes and free meals. Sponsors and questions to [jeremias.kangas@kangasbros.fi](mailto:jeremias.kangas@kangasbros.fi).
