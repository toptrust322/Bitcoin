title: Bitcoin-Qt version 0.8.4 released
---
Bitcoin-Qt version 0.8.4 is now available for download at:
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.8.4/>

This is a maintenance release to fix a critical bug and three
security issues; we urge all users to upgrade.

There were no changes from 0.8.4 release candidate 2, so if you are running
0.8.4rc2 you do not need to upgrade.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues>
