  description: The original software written by Satoshi Nakamoto, the project's founder. If you aren't sure which program to pick, this is a good bet. This application is a peer-to-peer client that builds the backbone of the Bitcoin network. It is suited for enthusiasts, merchants, miners, developers and people who want to help support the project. People who run Bitcoin-Qt are first class network citizens and have the highest levels of security, privacy and stability. However, it can be very resource intensive and you should be willing to leave it running in the background so other computers can connect to yours. If your computer is low powered or you aren't willing to tolerate a 24-hour+ initial start time, you should consider other clients. Cutting edge features tend to be implemented in other clients first. 
  platforms:
  - name: linux
  - name: ubuntu

  - name: osx-uni
- name: MultiBit

  description: MultiBit's primary focus is being fast and easy to use, even for people with no technical knowledge. It has a YouTube channel to help you learn the software, and includes helpful features such as an exchange rate ticker. MultiBit supports many languages such as German, Spanish and Greek. MultiBit synchronizes with the network much faster than Bitcoin-Qt and should be ready for you to use within a few minutes. This is a good choice for non technical users who want an easy to use experience, especially if you use a Mac.

  - name: linux
  - name: ubuntu

- name: Armory
  url: bitcoinarmory.com
  image: armory.png
  description: Armory focuses on advanced wallet management features, such as the ability to construct transactions whilst disconnected from the internet. It operates in conjunction with a Bitcoin-Qt install. It requires a large amount of RAM to operate and if you use Windows, it requires a 64 bit version. It is a good choice for tech-savvy enthusiasts or merchants who want to try out cutting edge ideas in the Bitcoin world. Armory was partly funded by a community donation drive which raised over $4000.
  platforms:
  - name: linux
  - name: ubuntu
  - name: win
- name: Electrum
  url: ecdsa.org/electrum
  image: electrum.png
  description: Electrum's focus is speed, with low resource usage and making wallet backups easy. It operates in conjunction with remote servers that handle the most complicated parts of the Bitcoin system, which is why it's fast. However, by running this client you don't contribute your computer's resources to the core network, and the remote servers that help give it good performance have the ability to see all your transactions and tie them together. Whilst you need provide no personal information to use Electrum (as is true for all Bitcoin clients), this means the privacy level is lower than for other clients. Merchants are recommended to use other p2p clients. Electrum is not quite user friendly yet - currently it is more suited for tech-saavy individuals.

        <h1>Bitcoin Client Software</h1>
        <p>Bitcoin is a system of merchants, individuals, a network of participants and software. Together they maintain a mutually co-operating infrastructure without the need for authorities - a decentralised peer-to-peer system. A core layer of the Bitcoin system is the Bitcoin network through which people interact with it using Bitcoin client software. Below we list such software.</p>
        <p>Bitcoin clients are the base level of technology for conducting Bitcoin transactions. Clients usually store a collection of keys on that computer (often termed a wallet). These keys allow you to send and receive payments through the Bitcoin network. Nobody has access to these keys except yourself, and they must be kept secure. This is where clients differ, with ingenious strategies and ongoing research into making a user-friendly and secure client - not an easy task when both goals often conflict!</p>

            <p>Bitcoin is one of the first implementations of a concept called crypto-currency, which was first described in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list. Building upon the notion that money is any object, or any sort of record, accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given country or socio-economic context, Bitcoin is designed around the idea of using cryptography to control the creation and transfer of money, rather than relying on central authorities.</p>
